Cardiac Radiology;Cardiac Radiology: Centenary Review;Albert de                         Roos Charles B. Higgins;During the past century, cardiac imaging technologies have revolutionized the                     diagnosis and treatment of acquired and congenital heart disease. Many important                     contributions to the field of cardiac imaging were initially reported in                         Radiology. The field developed from the early stages of                     cardiac imaging, including the use of coronary x-ray angiography and roentgen                     kymography, to nowadays the widely used echocardiographic, nuclear medicine,                     cardiac computed tomographic (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) applications. It                     is surprising how many of these techniques were not recognized for their                     potential during their early inception. Some techniques were described in the                     literature but required many years to enter the clinical arena and presently                     continue to expand in terms of clinical application. The application of various                     CT and MR contrast agents for the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia is a case in                     point, as the utility of contrast agents continues to expand the noninvasive                     characterization of myocardium. The history of cardiac imaging has included a                     continuous process of advances in our understanding of the anatomy and                     physiology of the cardiovascular system, along with advances in imaging                     technology that continue to the present day.

Gastrointestinal Radiology;History, Evolution, and Current Status of Radiologic Imaging Tests                     for Colorectal Cancer Screening;Marc S. Levine Judy Yee;Colorectal cancer screening is thought to be an effective tool with which to                     reduce the mortality from colorectal cancer through early detection and removal                     of colonic adenomas and early colon cancers. In this article, we review the                     history, evolution, and current status of imaging tests of the                     colon—including single-contrast barium enema, double-contrast barium                     enema, computed tomographic (CT) colonography, and magnetic resonance (MR)                     colonography—for colorectal cancer screening. Despite its documented                     value in the detection of colonic polyps, the double-contrast barium enema has                     largely disappeared as a screening test because it is widely perceived as a                     labor-intensive, time-consuming, and technically demanding procedure. In the                     past decade, the barium enema has been supplanted by CT colonography as the                     major imaging test in colorectal cancer screening in the United States, with MR                     colonography emerging as another viable option in Europe. Although MR                     colonography does not require ionizing radiation, the radiation dose for CT                     colonography has decreased substantially, and regular screening with this                     technique has a high benefit-to-risk ratio. In recent years, CT colonography has                     been validated as an effective tool for use in colorectal cancer screening that                     is increasingly being disseminated.

Interventional Radiology;Interventional Radiology: A Half Century of                     Innovation;Richard A. Baum Stanley Baum;The evolution of modern interventional radiology began over half century ago with                     a simple question. Was it possible to use the same diagnostic imaging tools that                     had revolutionized the practice of medicine to guide the real-time treatment of                     disease? This disruptive concept led to rapid treatment advances in every organ                     system of the body. It became clear that by utilizing imaging some patients                     could undergo targeted procedures, eliminating the need for major surgery, while                     others could undergo procedures for previously unsolvable problems. The breadth                     of these changes now encompasses all of medicine and has forever changed the way                     we think about disease. In this brief review article, major advances in the                     field, as chronicled in the pages of Radiology, will be                     described.

Molecular Imaging;State of the Art: Response Assessment in Lung Cancer in the Era of Genomic Medicine;Mizuki Nishino Hiroto Hatabu Bruce E. Johnson Theresa C. McLoud;Tumor response assessment has been a foundation for advances in cancer therapy. Recent discoveries of effective targeted therapy for specific genomic abnormalities in lung cancer and their clinical application have brought revolutionary advances in lung cancer therapy and transformed the oncologist’s approach to patients with lung cancer. Because imaging is a major method of response assessment in lung cancer both in clinical trials and practice, radiologists must understand the genomic alterations in lung cancer and the rapidly evolving therapeutic approaches to effectively communicate with oncology colleagues and maintain the key role in lung cancer care. This article describes the origin and importance of tumor response assessment, presents the recent genomic discoveries in lung cancer and therapies directed against these genomic changes, and describes how these discoveries affect the radiology community. The authors then summarize the conventional Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and World Health Organization guidelines, which continue to be the major determinants of trial endpoints, and describe their limitations particularly in an era of genomic-based therapy. More advanced imaging techniques for lung cancer response assessment are presented, including computed tomography tumor volume and perfusion, dynamic contrast material–enhanced and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose and novel tracers. State-of-art knowledge of lung cancer biology, treatment, and imaging will help the radiology community to remain effective contributors to the personalized care of lung cancer patients.

Oncologic Imaging;History, Evolution, and Current Status of Radiologic Imaging Tests                     for Colorectal Cancer Screening;Marc S. Levine Judy Yee;Colorectal cancer screening is thought to be an effective tool with which to                     reduce the mortality from colorectal cancer through early detection and removal                     of colonic adenomas and early colon cancers. In this article, we review the                     history, evolution, and current status of imaging tests of the                     colon—including single-contrast barium enema, double-contrast barium                     enema, computed tomographic (CT) colonography, and magnetic resonance (MR)                     colonography—for colorectal cancer screening. Despite its documented                     value in the detection of colonic polyps, the double-contrast barium enema has                     largely disappeared as a screening test because it is widely perceived as a                     labor-intensive, time-consuming, and technically demanding procedure. In the                     past decade, the barium enema has been supplanted by CT colonography as the                     major imaging test in colorectal cancer screening in the United States, with MR                     colonography emerging as another viable option in Europe. Although MR                     colonography does not require ionizing radiation, the radiation dose for CT                     colonography has decreased substantially, and regular screening with this                     technique has a high benefit-to-risk ratio. In recent years, CT colonography has                     been validated as an effective tool for use in colorectal cancer screening that                     is increasingly being disseminated.
Oncologic Imaging;State of the Art: Response Assessment in Lung Cancer in the Era of Genomic Medicine;Mizuki Nishino Hiroto Hatabu Bruce E. Johnson Theresa C. McLoud;Tumor response assessment has been a foundation for advances in cancer therapy. Recent discoveries of effective targeted therapy for specific genomic abnormalities in lung cancer and their clinical application have brought revolutionary advances in lung cancer therapy and transformed the oncologist’s approach to patients with lung cancer. Because imaging is a major method of response assessment in lung cancer both in clinical trials and practice, radiologists must understand the genomic alterations in lung cancer and the rapidly evolving therapeutic approaches to effectively communicate with oncology colleagues and maintain the key role in lung cancer care. This article describes the origin and importance of tumor response assessment, presents the recent genomic discoveries in lung cancer and therapies directed against these genomic changes, and describes how these discoveries affect the radiology community. The authors then summarize the conventional Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and World Health Organization guidelines, which continue to be the major determinants of trial endpoints, and describe their limitations particularly in an era of genomic-based therapy. More advanced imaging techniques for lung cancer response assessment are presented, including computed tomography tumor volume and perfusion, dynamic contrast material–enhanced and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose and novel tracers. State-of-art knowledge of lung cancer biology, treatment, and imaging will help the radiology community to remain effective contributors to the personalized care of lung cancer patients.
